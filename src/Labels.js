It is not displayed to you, but is a version of the text with the diacritics (e.g. accent marks) removed, uppercase converted to lowercase, and punctuation removed. The importance of the nnp property is that it allows you to search without worrying about case, accents, or punctuation. What is returned back from a search is the actual text, not the nnp."
      , secDocPropsP03: "Note that in the search function (described below), the phrase Value (nonsensitive) means the search uses the nnp property, and the phrase Search (sensitive) means the search uses the Value property."

      , secDocSearchAdvancedP24: "ends with means the desired word or phrase must occur at the end of the property value."
      , secDocSearchAdvancedP25: "matches regular expression means that you are not entering a simple word or phrase, but you are using a special tool known as a regular expression. See below."
      , secDocSearchAdvancedP26: "Tip: In a dropdown, if you start typing, it will filter the dropdown values to match what you are typing."
      , secDocSearchRegExP01: "The use of regular expressions is a powerful but very advanced feature. To learn about regular expressions in general, search the Internet. The following information specific to this database is adapted from a Neo4j manual:"
      , secDocSearchRegExP02: "The regular expression syntax used by the database is inherited from the Java regular expressions. This includes support for flags that change how strings are matched, including case-insensitive (?i), multiline (?m) and dotall (?s). Flags are given at the start of the regular expression."
      , secDocSearchRegExP03: "If the string you want does not occur at the start of the property, it is necessary to put .* before the string. And, if it does not occur at the end, it is necessary to put .* at the end. For example, doing a regular expression search using the expression blessed will only find docs that both start with and end with blessed. There are none. The expression blessed.* will find docs that start with the word blessed. The expression .*blessed will find docs that end with the word blessed. And the expression .*blessed.* will find docs that have the word blessed anywhere in the text. This is such a simple example that you would not use a regular expression. But, it illustrates the use of .* when creating regular expressions."
      , secDocSearchRegExP04: "Regular expressions can be escaped using a forward slash. Remember that back slash needs to be escaped in string literals."
      , secDocSearchRegExP05: "By pre-pending a regular expression with (?i), the whole expression becomes case insensitive."
      , secDocSearchRegExP06: "Let's consider an example of the use of a regular expression. Let's say that we are interested in seeing places in the liturgical text where we ask for God to do something through the prayers or intercessions of someone.. We could use the following regular expression: .*through the (prayers|intercessions) of.*"
      , secDocSearchRegExP07: "We have .* at the beginning and end to search for its occurrence anywhere in a doc. And, we want to search for either prayers or intercessions, so we put them in parentheses and separate the two words using the pipe symbol | which in a regular expression means or."
      , secDocSearchRegExP09: "When we examine the results of the search, we can see that the phrase 'through the prayers of' or the phrase 'through the intercessions of' has the following petitioners:"
      , secDocSearchRegExP10: "Apostles"

      , secDocSearchRegExP19: "You can also use regular expressions to search the Greek docs. The Greek equivalent regular expression to find the variations of the phrase kingdom of God or heaven or the Father in the Greek text is .*βασιλεια.*(Θεια|οθρανων|πατρος).*"
      , secDocSearchResultsP01a: "Below is an example of the result of searching for the phrase"

      , secDocSearchResultsP02: "There are many things to note about the screen shot above..."
      , secDocSearchResultsP03: "Directly below the search text box, the Search Result line tells you how many docs matched your search request. In this case, it found three docs."
      , secDocSearchResultsP04: "Each matching doc is shown as its own row."
      , secDocSearchResultsP05: "Below the rows of matching docs is a message that tells you how many rows are being displayed. In this case, it is showing rows 1 to 3 of 3. That means all the matching docs fit on a single web page. (See below about what happens if the rows don't all fit on a page)."
      , secDocSearchResultsP06: "Notice that the search phrase your kingdom of is all lowercase and has no punctuation. But, the search result was Your kingdom, of and your kingdom, of. The simple search ignores capitalization, diacritics, and punctuation."
      , secDocSearchResultsP07: "Note that below the Search Result line there is a text box that says type here to filter search results.... Once you have found docs, you can filter them by typing additional words."
      , secDocSearchResultsP08: "The column headings of the results table have small up and down arrows. Click these to sort the results by a particular column."

If you click the radio button, a popup appears and the you will see a new table that shows you all the docs that have the same topic and key. In other words, the app uses the ID of the doc you select to do a new search, but ignores the domain. This allows you to easily compare translations."
      , secDocSearchResultsP10: "Note that if the number of docs found are too many to fit on a single page, you will see something like this:"
      , secDocSearchResultsP11: "This tells you that there are 746 rows (i.e. docs) and it is showing rows 1 to 30. Notice on the right there are page numbers. You can jump directly to a page. Or you can go to the next page using the > button, or to the last page using the >> button. Keep in mind that page here refers to a page of search results, not a page in a biblical or liturgical book."

      , secSimpleSearch: "Simple Search"
      , secDocIdP01: "When the Bible was written, it did not have chapter and verse numbers. These were added centuries later so that people have a common, standardized way to talk about a specific part of the Bible. A biblical chapter and verse number uniquely identifies a small document (or, doc for short). For biblical text, we call that kind of doc a verse."
      , secDocIdP02: "Fr. Seraphim Dedes has created the equivalent of chapter and verse identifiers for the Eastern Orthodox Christian liturgical texts. This identification scheme is used in AGES Liturgical Workbench (ALWB), jointly developed by AGES, Initiatives, Inc. and OCMC."
      , secDocIdP03: "Each doc in the database has an ID that uniquely identifies it. The ID is composed of three parts:"
      , secDocIdP04: "The domain is equivalent to the version of a Bible translation. For example, KJV for the King James Version of the Bible. The topic is equivalent to a Bible book name. For example the book of Genesis. The key is equivalent to the chapter and verse number."
      , secDocIdP05: "In order to understand how each doc is uniquely identified in the database, consider the following:"
      , secDocIdP06: "The text is from the Menaion, Month 1, Day 6, that is, the Theophany of our Lord. Let's look at the ID. The ID is composed of the domain, topic, and key."
      , secDocIdP07: "Let's start with the topic. In this case, the topic part of the ID is me.m01.d06. Note that topics often have parts separated by a period. The first part me means Menaion. The second part m01 means Month 1. The last part d06 means Day 6."
      , secDocIdP08: "Now, look at the key meVE.Apolytikion1.text. Again, me means Menaion. VE means Vespers. The key also indicates this is Apolytikion 1, which is the dismissal hymn for Vespers."
      , secDocIdP09: "Lastly, look at the domain. Notice that the two rows (one English and one Greek) have the different domains, but the same topic and key."
      , secDocIdP10: "A domain is equivalent to a Bible version, for example, RSV, the Revised Standard Version. A domain has three parts:"
      , secDocIdP11: "Language Code"
      , secDocIdP12: "Country Code"
      , secDocIdP13: "Realm"
      , secDocIdP14: "The language code is a 2-3 character code from the International Standards Organization (ISO) and uniquely identifies a language. The country code is from the ISO country code table. A realm is an identifier for a particular translator, a particular diocese, or metropolis."
      , secDocIdP15: "Let's look at the domain gr gr cog. The first gr is the language code, and means Greek. Note that the ISO code for modern Greek is el, so gr signifies non-modern Greek, e.g. Classical, or Hellenistic, or Byzantine. The second gr means the country Greece. The realm cog is an acronymn and means Common Orthodox Greek, in other words, the Greek liturgical text commonly used by Orthodox Christians around the world."
      , secDocIdP16: "The domain en us dedes means, English as spoken in the United States, translation by Fr. Seraphim Dedes. Although it is not shown here, another example is en uk lash, which means English as spoken in the United Kingdom, translation by Fr. Ephrem Lash (of blessed memory)."
